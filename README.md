## Movie similarities analysis by plot.

The purpose of this is non comercial, just for trying out ML algorithms.

The dataset has the top 100 movies from IMDb with the plots of Wikipedia and IMDb. The idea is to associate movies just by the plots and find similarities.

The tools used are: **SnowballStemmer**, **TfidfVectorizer**, **KMeans** and **dendrogram** using `NLTK`, `Scikit-learn`, `SciPy` and `matplotlib`.

The dataset was published in Datacamp and was submitted by **Anubhav Singh**.

This notebook is based on [Anubhav Singh's Datacamp Project](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/648).
